  * Taking in consideration all the categories and subcategories the campaign with goals between 1,000 and 4,999 has the largest amounts of projects as well it has a succesful rate of 66%.

  * From a total of 1047 plays just the 66.3% have been successful with a failure of 100% in the month of October. Goals between 0 and 19,999 has the highest rate of success with 50% or more.

For the Play subcategory located in the Theatre category based on the months that it have been launched we can see the following insights:

  * For some reason May has the most successful projects we need aditional data to determine the specific reasons for this.
  
  * December has the worst numbers the main reason could be the Christmas and New Years Even season. People and companies are speding more rather than donate to any project. 


### Conclusion
In conclusion, Louise's need to see the posible effect of seasons in the different campaigns, like Christmas where the the failure rate was higher. The amount of the goal needed to make the project succed will depend if the money must be collected. The best advices is to focus in goals between 0 and 19,999 that show 50% or more to succed. Since Louise needs to crowdsource $10,000 there is a high probability of success.
